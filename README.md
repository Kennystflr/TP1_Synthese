# Rapport d'Ã©tonnement :

- When I just begun this Lab I had so many problems running CLion on a Linux Machine I felt overwhelmed...
- I first had to catch up because I was so late.
- Then I dived in and had for goal to do things with logic and make my code easily readable.
- I had to make sure I didn't write magical numbers even 0 and 1 were hidden in MACROs.
